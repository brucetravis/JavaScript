## 🎯 Project Aim (Goal)
To create a simple web application that calculates and displays how much each person should pay when splitting a bill, including a tip.

The main aim of this project is to strengthen my understanding of core JavaScript concepts by building a practical application that:

- Accepts user input for the bill amount, tip percentage, and number of people
- Calculates the total tip and total amount per person
- Displays the result in a user-friendly format

## 🚀 Features

- Dynamic calculation of:
  - Tip amount per person
  - Total amount per person
- Input validation to ensure meaningful results
- Clean and responsive UI (optional if styled with CSS)
- Built with vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
